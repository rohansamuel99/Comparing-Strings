# take 2 strings and assign a number to k and split them in rolling k's or normal spilts. 
# take the k-mers from both the strings and compare them side by side, and then use the number of characters between 2 similar k-mers from the strings 
# to find the distance between the k-mers
# this can be done by assigning the strings to a list and then parsing through the list to find k-mers
